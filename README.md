Hi, I have 10 years experience of many different programming languages. I am working on iOS App Development for last 5 years. I enjoy all the challenges this industry offers; leadership, delivery, technology, customer satisfaction, innovation and on-going learning. I like to keep things simple, stay agile and responsive, so I can meet requirements quickly.  I will always continue to work for better quality and better. I see software not as a job, but as a passion and a great pleasure.
